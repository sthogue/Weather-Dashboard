# Weather-Dashboard
5 day Weather Dashboard 
The weather app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript,  & ServerAPIs.

Users will first click enter the city they want to look up the weather for. Once they hit the submit button, they will see the current date, temperature, humidity %, and wind speeds. It will also show the consecutive 5 days and their date, temperature, humidity %, and wind.

The script will automatically add the city to the left-hand column to then be able to search for that city again quickly. 

## Limitations: 
Only US zip codes work, and sometimes the zip codes render a section of a city and not the official city name. Also, for smaller towns, you will have to put "town name","State", USA to render the town you are looking for. 

Currently, if you click on the button to call back a recent city, it will add it twice. Still working on this code to fix the issue

Most of the CSS was used from a previous project to cut down on time to complete the assignment.
